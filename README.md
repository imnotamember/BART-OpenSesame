# BART-OpenSesame
This is a behavioral version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task coded for OpenSesame

In order to run this you can either download and open the self-contained experiment file in OpenSesame:

`BART.osexp`

or you can reconstruct the script:

`OS_Script.txt`

by copy/pasting it into a new OpenSesame experiment by clicking on the top item of the new experiment and clicking the "General Script" button, then pasting the script contents into the new space (replacing all info currently shown in the General Script). After that just add the files in the folder "FilePool" to your experiment and you should be good to go!
